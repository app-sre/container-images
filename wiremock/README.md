# Wiremock

WireMock is an open-source tool primarily used for API mock testing. It simulates HTTP-based APIs, allowing you to create stable development and test environments.

This is especially useful for:
* Isolating your application from flaky or unreliable third-party APIs.
* Simulating APIs that are not yet built or are still in development.
* Creating stable environments for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
